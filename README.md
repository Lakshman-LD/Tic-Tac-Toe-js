# Tic-Tac-Toe-js
- A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game written in spidermonkey(javascript).
- No AI(minimax) algorithm included.

### SpiderMonkey
- Came to know that such a javascript shell exists, when I was searching for "How to input through javascript console other than dialog box."
- SpiderMonkey on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiderMonkey_(software)).
- SpiderMonkey is Mozilla's JavaScript engine written in C/C++.
- **Interesting Fact** that SpiderMonkey is the code name for the first-ever JavaScript engine, written by **Brendan Eich** at Netscape Communications.
- SpiderMonkey is same as node shell or regular javascript, but **readline()** to get console input is present in SpiderMonkey, Which is not in javascript.


### Usage
- Install SpiderMonkey shell by following the mozilla documentation. Takes a step or two.
- **js tictac.js**.

### Future Implementation
- Implement minimax algorithm, thus making computer undefeatable. So, it's either draw or computer wins.
